Documentation is not always required in every software. You can leave a blank README, and it would still be fine, simply because no one cares. People only care if it installs or not, after so, the next thing people would do is to run the software.

Have you ever being interested in a project, but there's not a single instruction for building / running the software? Which will then result in a waste of time surfing the web just to get the software working.
