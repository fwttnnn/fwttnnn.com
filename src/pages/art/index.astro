<Main title="Art" description="I like to draw">
    <p>I like to draw, was. I remembered that i used to draw things after my brain randomly gave me flashbacks of an old image of my drawing:</p>
    <img src="images/art_gundam.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="" width={300} height={533} />
    <p>This gundam art is essentially a copy from an image of gundam in real life, this art was made with an iPhone.</p>
    <p>With the second version having colors:</p>
    <img src="images/art_gundam_colored.png" loading="lazy" alt="" width={300} height={533} />
    <p>That "ywk" is a signature that this piece was made by me, youkwhd. I honestly like the gundam without proper hands, for some reason. It might be my weird taste on art.</p>
