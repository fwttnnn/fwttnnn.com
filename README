Generating RSS feeds
--------------------

I use python3 to generate rss feeds, run the file scripts/rss.py
to generate the file public/rss.xml, this guide section is
likely my personal note.

Next.js environment var
-----------------------

Next.js will automatically load your .env files, while also
setting up 2 default env variables, such as FZ and NODE_ENV.

Possible values for NODE_ENV are the following:

- test
- development
- production

For whatever reasons variable TEST, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION will
be true if the above following set.

This information was extracted from the following source code
