1) Testing
----------

Each tests should be written in python, as it is easier to parse
out html with existing libraries like `BeautifulSoup4`.

You should find all the test cases inside tests/ folder.

Run the following command to run every tests:

    yarn test

2) Deploying
------------

Make sure to run all the tests first before deploying, only then
you are good to deploy to production.

In order to deploy (configured for vercel), run the following
command:

    yarn deploy

The command above will run all the tests, and will deploy if all
the tests returns exit code 0.
