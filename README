Pure HTML webpage written in Clojure powered by Hiccup, with no
Javascript shipped on production.

TODO:
    - Reduce image sizes

Quick Start
-----------

Run the command below and everything should be built:

./build.sh

Then start your favorite server, I'd recommend to use:
    
    - Serve by Vercel <https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve>
    - Python HTTP Server <https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html>

Testing
-------

Each tests should be written in python, as it is easier to parse
out html with existing libraries like `BeautifulSoup4`.

You should find all the test cases inside tests/ folder.

Contributing
------------

Any contribution is welcome, it is encouraged to create a new
branch with a prefix of patch-* before making any pull request.
