<h2 id="a-brief-of-python">A brief of python</h2>
<h3 id="where-does-this-section-of-code-belong-to">Where does this section of code belong to?</h3>
<p>After some tweakings with Flask, parsing HTMLs, some one-line shorthands, i now can state that <em>i don't like python</em>. That is because of it's <strong>syntax</strong>. Actually, some part of the syntax, for example there is no curly brackets, or <code>end</code>-like syntax to keep track of the code inside the block. An example of this can be found in various languages.</p>
<p>In ruby, the syntax could be something like this:</p>
<pre class="language-ruby"><code class="language-ruby"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token method-definition"><span class="token function">gimme_bacon</span></span>
	puts <span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">"Bacon plz."</span></span>
<span class="token keyword">end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas in python:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code class="language-python"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">hello_world</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
	<span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"hello world"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Well, this were compared with a fairly minimal code, i'm pretty sure that most of developers loves the python one? sure. But it's getting worse if you have something big inside the block, plus if it's nested. What i mean is that, you will be easily lost where you are on the block. Take a look at this piece of code:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>There, i was trying to implement the code highlighting feature for this webpage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the fact that i'm trying to implement the feature by myself instead of using markdown extension.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When compared on a text editor, it's hard to keep track of what chunk of code belongs to which block (for loop, functions), for example, the line <code>post.html = str(soup)</code> is hard to be known if it belongs to the <code>for code_tags in codes</code> or the function itself. If only i had the ability to use <code>end</code>-like keyword, it would be easier to see.</p>
<h3 id="when-there-is-the-end-keyword">When there is the end keyword</h3>
<p>This is an example if python has some kind of <code>end</code>-like keyword to seperate blocks.</p>

<p>Now it's a easier to find where it belongs to. That is why i don't like python for it's syntax. I had to navigate from top to bottom to process this code's behaviour.</p>
<h3 id="will-i-use-python-in-the-future">Will i use python in the future?</h3>
<p><strong>YES</strong>. <em>Absolutely</em>. I will continue to code in python, but not as my primary go-to language, of course as a <strong>scripting</strong> language. A language that is easy to use, a language that will always be there when i need, it comes with all over the GNU/Linux-based systems, mostly there will be python ready to use.</p>
<p>Also <strong>NO</strong>, for anything unrelated to scripting, never gonna use it for something like this again. If i would build something like this, i might just jump to WASM, it's been attracting me lately. Maybe using a fresh language like Rust or Go.</p>
<p>Apart from that, i'm more interested to bash as a scripting language, so..</p>
<h2 id="project-layout">Project layout</h2>
<p>This is how the project layout looks as for now. Or you can navigate to this app's <a href="https://github.com/youkwhd/youkwhd.herokuapp.com">repository</a> to find out.</p>

<p>The core of this application is mostly at the <code>app/views/*</code> and <code>app/__init__.py</code>. This is more likely a "functional" layout. A more common layout is the "divisional splitting", that's what they said. An example of divisional splitting can be found on <a href="https://gitlab.com/patkennedy79/flask-recipe-app">this repository</a>.</p>
<p>As a someone who is coming from Node.js, i like my current layout better than any. The reason is simple, every directory is self-explanatory.</p>
<h2 id="parsing-blog-posts">Parsing blog posts</h2>
<p>On this day, i'm using a pre-configured extension for the library Markdown. Before, i wasn't using it, instead, i use BeautifulSoup4. There is a reason behind this.</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn't know there was extensions, i thought there was nothing as such.</li>
<li>Why would i solve leetcode-like problems if i don't even practice it on the real world?</li>
</ol>
<p>And so, i began to build up the necessary features for my needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to have Table of contents</li>
<li>Code highlighting</li>
<li>Nothing else.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is it. Everything i need. The essentials for a standart blog.</p>
<h3 id="generating-table-of-contents">Generating Table of contents</h3>
<p>Starting with the ability to have Table of contents, i first need to attach IDs for each headings / titles. Here's a code snippet showing how i accomplish it:</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code class="language-python"><span class="token decorator annotation punctuation">@blueprints</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">"posts"</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>route<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"/posts/&#x3C;slug>/"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">post</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>slug<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
	post <span class="token operator">=</span> get_post<span class="token punctuation">(</span>slug<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
	soup <span class="token operator">=</span> BeautifulSoup<span class="token punctuation">(</span>post<span class="token punctuation">.</span>html<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"html.parser"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

	<span class="token keyword">for</span> heading_tag <span class="token keyword">in</span> soup<span class="token punctuation">.</span>find_all<span class="token punctuation">(</span>re<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token builtin">compile</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'^h[1-6]$'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
		<span class="token comment"># replace all non-alphanumeric characters</span>
		heading_tag_id <span class="token operator">=</span> re<span class="token punctuation">.</span>sub<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">r'[\W]+'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"-"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> heading_tag<span class="token punctuation">.</span>string<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>lower<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

		<span class="token comment"># clean ups, don't mind this while loop</span>
		<span class="token keyword">while</span> heading_tag_id<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">==</span> <span class="token string">"-"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>
				heading_tag_id <span class="token operator">=</span> heading_tag_id<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token builtin">len</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>heading_tag_id<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">-</span> <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span>

		<span class="token comment"># append the generated id</span>
		heading_tag<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'id'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> heading_tag_id

	post<span class="token punctuation">.</span>html <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">str</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>soup<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
	<span class="token keyword">return</span> render_template<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"posts/slug.html"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> post<span class="token operator">=</span>post<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now i can implement Table of contents. Turns out, it's hard to accomplish. I mean, it's easy enough to generate the Table of contents. What's hard is to maintain the best structure. I had hard times deciding on what to check if the headings actually need to open a new ul tag or just appending it on, also, it's hard to have the correct "pointer" to the desired tag to append with.</p>
<p>It's just hard. The thing is, i did it. But didn't made it as great as the pre-configured extension (we'll come back to this later). My Table of contents's structure is a mess.</p>
<h3 id="attempting-for-code-highlighting">Attempting for code highlighting</h3>
<p>The extension CodeHilite follows the John Gruber's <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">markdown syntax</a>, with a little tweakings done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used 4 spaces + colons for any code i wrote in markdown following John Gruber's syntax. The complete syntax can be found at the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">CodeHilite extension docs</a>.</p>
<h4 id="before-knowing-extensions-is-a-thing">Before knowing extensions is a thing</h4>
<p>I tried to parse the code myself then highlight it using Pygments. Without realizing the syntax is wrong. The code snippet when i tried to parse it myself:</p>

<p>I was using the three backticks instead of colons.</p>
<p>After trying to write C code, things starting to break, from there. I checked the <a href="https://flask-flatpages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#configuration">Flask-FlatPages docs</a>, and realized that there is extensions for highlighting code. Wasted time.</p>
<h4 id="oh-there-is-extensions-for-the-markdown-library">Oh, there is extensions for the Markdown library</h4>
<p>Now i ditched Flask-FlatPages (Flask-FlatPages is relying on Markdown lib), and started to use the Markdown library by itself.</p>
<p>From there, i refactored my code to use the CodeHilite extension. I don't want to waste my time implementing a feature that is already implemented.</p>
<h3 id="regenerating-table-of-contents">Regenerating Table of contents</h3>
<p>As i said before, my version of Table of contents's <strong>structure</strong> is not that great.</p>
<p>When compared to the extension's, the <strong>visual effect</strong> is just the same.</p>
<p>Here is a comparison of the structure between mine and extension's:</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>ul</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
	<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>li</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
		<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>ul</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;/</span>ul</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The extension could generate a more cleaner structure:</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>ul</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

</code></pre>
<p>This is due to the limited data i have. The Markdown library should have something better than parsing using a list of BeautifulSoup4 objects. If i put more effort and time to this, i'm sure i would be able to have the same output.</p>
<p>Thus i chose what just works. I had my experience making my own, so it's ok for me to just throw my code apart.</p>
<h2 id="styling-the-flask-app">Styling the Flask app</h2>
<p>The styling should be as minimal. It should look like a plain HTML Document. I don't know why i'm more attracted to these kind of sites that is just plain but informative. Rather than fancy looking personal websites.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Migrating to Flask, hello again python.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first language was python, that's why i chose python. It's just a bit easier to migrate to. Also learnt more python things like decorators, virtualenv, packages layout &#x26; probably <code>__name__</code> and <code>__main__</code> variables. You probably already know why i'm using Flask rather than Django if you are a python developer yourself. Long story short, Flask is just easier to work with and lightweight, blazingly python-fast.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="choosing-between-perl-rust--c">Choosing between Perl, Rust &#x26; C.</h2>
<p>I actually wanted to migrate my blog to Perl using mojolicious and if not probably will do WASM with Rust using Yew. But it didn't happen, i stopped in the middle of the road with both Rust and Perl realizing that i'm still on a journey learning C, lol this is why u shouldn't hop languages. But you know, learning C opens up a bunch of keywords, I learnt heaps, pointers, buffers, addresses, <code>free()</code>, <code>malloc()</code>, segfaults, and a lot more frustrating things, i've been reading the ncurses lib manual.</p>
<p>As i said before on the <a href="https://youkwhd.vercel.app/posts/the-future-of-this-blog">previous blog post</a>, i wanted to make my own static site generator that can be deployed to github pages or netlify, and other similiar providers. Well yeah that is still on the list. It's just that i don't wanna stick with Next.js any longer, i'm not aiming to be a soydev.</p>
<p>Rust, i love it, i don't want to switch to a scripting language again. Perl, is it me doing something wrong or the tests are taking so long, also love it, just takes time. Also, disclaimer; what i'm doing is really bad if you are programming for a job, don't hop between languages or even frameworks itself, just stick with your leetcode problems.</p>
<h2 id="features-like-table-of-contents">Features like table of contents</h2>
<p>I will attempt to make table of contents by parsing either the markdown or html. I also need to implement things like auto new tab for external link, code highlightling, etc. Also, a remainder to myself, try to ditch Flask-Flatpages, instead directly use a markdown parser, this will give you a lot of freedom to your project.</p>
<h2 id="styling-this-flask-app">Styling this Flask app</h2>
<p>Not much is going to change from the default style, i will keep it simple. No dark backgounds for now, there will also be no banners. Tho i will work to display it, just not for now. Maybe i'm the one that somehow doesn't like fancy personal websites with a lot of animation on, or perhaps just the aesthetics. That's why a lot of my personal webpages are plain, old and lifeless. With that in mind, this app will remain raw.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bad habit i have is that i always rush when developing my projects. I felt like time is ticking faster when i do my works, thus that makes make me uncautious to small things to consider.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="the-pull-request-i-made-on-github">The pull request i made on github</h2>
<p>At first glance, i intended to fix an error on the site <a href="https://glfmn.io">glfmn.io</a>, glad it was on github, the problem was with it's HTTP 404 not found page, for more information, you can find the <a href="https://github.com/glfmn/glfmn.io/pull/4">pull request</a> archive here. Then an idea came into my mind, it was to add a new feature, a vim-like bindings, simply because the site was using Gruvbox as a color scheme, plus it's design looks like a terminal, am i right? 🧐</p>
<p>It might be <strong>bad</strong> for the ecosystem. What i mean by that is, there's web browser extensions for such feature, like: <a href="https://vimium.github.io/">Vivium</a> &#x26; <a href="https://ueokande.github.io/vim-vixen/">Vim Vixen</a>, and i myself is using it right now. With that known, the bindings should be the same, as they the extensions are also following vim bindings, thus could make things feel a bit clunky, bindings are being overwritten either by the extension or the site.</p>
<p>Well, it's bad right? or is it? only if the bindings aren't getting overwritten.</p>
<h2 id="dont-think-twice-just-go-for-it">Don't think twice, just go for it.</h2>
<p>While there is some bad affection, not all applications will get affected by independent feature. Taken an example of vim-bindings, some applications have those integrated. Because it is a standalone app, it shouldn't make any problem, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/goballooning/vim-live-latex-preview">vim-live-latex-preview</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zathura_(document_viewer)">zathura</a>, <a href="https://www.notabug.org/g0tsu/litemdview">litemdview</a>, etc.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, the tool that you are going to use is not the best solution for the current project that you're building. It is okay to reproduce other people's projects with your preferenced tools, such as the programming language itself. It's a good way to learn, that makes you more comfortable with your current knowledge, but still, always learn the fundamentals, not the tool you're using.</p>

<h2 id="an-example-of-two-different-softwares">An example of two different softwares</h2>
<p>Before i wrote this article, i was looking for a software that plays a certain sound after you click a key on your keyboard, so then i can make my keyboard sounds like a mechanical keyboard. I found two softwares that's capable of doing it, those are <a href="https://github.com/hainguyents13/mechvibes">Mechvibes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zevv/bucklespring">Bucklespring</a>, between those two, Mechvibes is the most popular one in general, i guess it's because the software is easy to install on Windows. But Bucklespring has a higher rate of stars on Github.</p>
<h3 id="the-tools-each-software-uses">The tools each software uses</h3>
<p>Mechvibes however uses JavaScript as the main programming language. And it's an Electron app, wow. The performance is.. not quite good. I even have some issues when using Mechvibes, it sometimes delays after idling away from your keyboard. And just like other Electron apps, it ate a lot of my CPU.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Electron bundles Chromium, for displaying UI</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other side, Bucklespring uses C as the main programming language. And it's a good choice knowing that this kind of software needs to communicate to your keyboard, or atleast listening for keyboard presses. The result is, it doesn't burn my CPU usage, and between these two, Bucklespring has the tiniest size, around 5.4 MB, while Mechvibes's size is sitting at around 60 - 80MB (executeables), this should be Electron's problem. But still, it's around 11 times bigger than the size of Bucklespring.</p>
<h2 id="another-example-when-developing-websites">Another example when developing websites</h2>
<p>WebAssembly is fast, now i'm free from JavaScript!! Go is faster than TypeScript, bye Node.js! well, not quite. Why not use Go as the backend language and TypeScript for the frontend? everything has their own drawbacks and advantages.. bla, bla, bla, i know you've heard that shit over and over.</p>
<p>As i said before, in my opinion, it is okay to build your projects with the tech stacks that you prefer. Especially when you're just getting started. It's best to just keep things simple, one programming language while learning the fundamentals, build up your problem solving skills, not for remembering syntaxes, not the programming language, that's that. Go has concurrency: goroutines, channels, mutex, etc. And it is the go-to language for making the backend and can perform faster than TypeScript. I do agree if someone recommends Go over TypeScript.</p>
<p>When making a small scale applications, you can use TypeScript on both frontend and backend (as if you're solo). It can boost your development environment. And it's community is wide. The ecosystem on TypeScript is also greater than Go's.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bucklespring is more efficient than Mechvibes, Go is better for the backend part. But that doesn't force you to only create applications with certain tool. Therefore, those are some examples of choosing the right tool for the right job. Use the one that suits your situation.</p>
<p>Happy hacking.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Something just doesn't feel as rewarding if i myself didn't build this site from scratch, i might just consider making a new one from scratch and make use of bash scripting or make my own simple static site generator using the holy C that supports markdown, including all the third party packages. Or this "plan" will be my side project. Considering i need more knowledge on Typescript for web development, more preferably Javascript itself.</p>

<h2 id="over-engineering-things">Over engineering things</h2>
<p>I was on the state of not knowing what to do, these are the days i was living on dormitory, then some days passed when i realize Arch Wiki's site was a good reference to my blog. It has neat features, some of them are table of contents, categories, etc. I as a bored person, not knowing what to do next, was fired up to implement these features onto my site. And it was a good experience personally, but rather became a bad practice.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-posts-tags">Working with posts tags</h3>
<p>If you haven't noticed, every posts has it's own tags, you can <a href="/posts/tags">check it</a> by clicking the link. I personally happy that i can accomplish this feature, it was a first good feature to implement on this kind of site, a blog. But then, as time flies, now i know that it's just not a good feature to implement if you don't have a specific article to write, like, only writing web development related content. It's always is a pain in the ass to just specify the "name" of a variable in programming, i also has felt it on making these tags. This feature might get deleted soon as i learn from mistakes, to not over engineer something.</p>
<h3 id="the-newest-feature-table-of-contents">The newest feature, table of contents</h3>
<p>There we go, now i can rest back to being a bored person, lmao. I've made this blog like it's a big ass site that's content change overtime. As i mentioned before, this was one of the good feature that i can implement on a blog. For this one, i might just keep it. Cause i'm overall somewhat happy for it, there's one bug that the library remark-toc or remark-html made, it generates <code>&#x3C;p>&#x3C;/p></code> tag in between lists on a certain condition, if the list were nested, that makes the table of contents unconsistent. It actually has some helpful features. But it's optional, no one might not use it, cause again, this site is not a wiki or a big ass company site, who knows. Or am i just overthinking?</p>
<h2 id="no-javascript-shall-be-included">No javascript shall be included</h2>
<p>Even tho this site is built using Typescript, it shouldn't bundle Javascript on build / production version. I don't hate Javascript, i just wanted to reduce the size of this site. Next.js or React itself has some downside on including and excluding Javascript, there should be Javascript or no Javascript at all. You can not have hybrid pages, as far as i know. This one feature has already been implemented using the SSG from Next.js, as i said before, i might build up my own simple SSG using C.</p>
<h2 id="images-and-its-size">Images and it's size</h2>
<p>I've tried optimizing this site's size, after doing some inspection, turns out that images are one of the factor that bloats this site. I probably will gonna remove images for upcoming updates. Might just use pure text and referring images as links.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Well, i like suckless softwares; dwm, dmenu, st, etc. It suck less, non bloated, then the way it's configured, the patches that is available, and it is widely customizable. What about other Window Managers? they all the same, it's just the programming language that's differ from others, the way it's configured, the maintainer, functionality. But really, when it comes to ricing, it does not matter.</p>
<p>take a look at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youkwhd/dotfiles/master/screenshots/wm__screenshot-04.png">my recent gnu/linux rice</a>.</p>
<p>the color scheme matched the wallpaper in the background, st has transparency, then there's big gaps in between. Also, the font matched with the environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>here are my <a href="https://github.com/youkwhd/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> configs.</p>

<p>the fact is that i can make the same layout using i3, i mean the <strong>exact same</strong> as the screenshot above. Now we know that any Window Managers are viable. Use the one that you comfort to use with.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-really-makes-it-perfect">Things that really makes it perfect</h2>
<p>After months of ricing GNU/Linux, now i can share the things i think really makes the difference. These are my thoughts on why some GNU/Linux rice looks bad.</p>
<p>take a look at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youkwhd/dotfiles/master/screenshots/wm__screenshot-08.png">my first rice</a>, i was using vanilla i3 at that time.</p>
<p>what do you see? Gruvbox. Nothing but a fullscreen terminal with i3status on top, no gaps, nothing. Straight plain.</p>
<p>what about the color scheme, isn't Gruvbox a good color scheme? yes indeed. I personally like it. But i wouldn't ever again staring at a fullscreen terminal, it just doesn't feel good.</p>
<p>then i switched to i3-gaps, it looks far more better, it is an ok environment. But i don't have any wallpaper installed. As you can guess, there is nothing but a blank black wallpaper and a non-transparent terminal. The result is still as bad.</p>
<p>Note that the font is an ok option in this case. Take a look at the i3status, one icon, then all the number stuff? what does the GiB section even mean? is it how much memory left? what is that? it confuses you. Plus the size of the i3status doesn't fit with the i3-gaps font base.</p>
<p>at that time, i thought i've made my rice to be as perfect as i want. But as time flies, i realize that this is beyond perfect, nothing special.</p>
<h2 id="add-some-gaps-even-if-its-small">Add some gaps even if it's small</h2>
<p>you will feel better if you add gaps. Just, trust me. It's the UI/UX thing. even a little bit of gaps can change the feel, just maybe 5 pixels for each window. I promise your WM will look better and fresh.</p>
<p>take a look at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youkwhd/dotfiles/master/screenshots/wm__screenshot-09.png">my i3 config</a> as if it has some gaps:</p>
<p>you've made some progress, and you've successfully made your window manager better.</p>
<h2 id="use-colorized-or-plain-wallpapers">Use colorized or plain wallpapers</h2>
<p>what you will regularly actually see is the background. Really tho, use one that looks super cool and the one that matches your style preferences. In case if you don't like to use wallpapers, you can use any plain wallpaper as an alternative. if you did used a plain wallpaper, you might want to match the terminal background color.</p>
<p>for an example; if i use a plain black wallpaper, then the terminal background saturation should be a little bit higher, still black but has more saturation on it.</p>
<h2 id="determine-your-terminal-transparency-and-prompt">Determine your terminal transparency and prompt</h2>
<p>you can have a non-transparent terminal but under a certain conditions, e.g the terminal background color must be pure black, then add paddings inside the terminal so it'll look more minimalist, or even add a border radius, and you can also put a very standing border color like pure white. Also, consider the prompt (PS1) to be minimal as well. for example:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> <span class="token assign-left variable"><span class="token environment constant">PS1</span></span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"\W > \[<span class="token variable"><span class="token variable">$(</span>tput sgr0<span class="token variable">)</span></span>\]"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>thus will render out:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">~ <span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">"youkwhd.github.io"</span> 
~ <span class="token operator">></span> yay -S icecat <span class="token function">vim</span>
</code></pre>
<p>here is one of an <a href="https://i.redd.it/kfbpylqmga701.png">example</a>.</p>
<p>the way to configure transparency, shadow, etc. Is to install a compositor for X, e.g. picom, Xcompmgr, Unagi.</p>
<p>in case if you were using cool and cozy wallpapers, then you can do something like a really long prompt, for example:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">export</span> <span class="token assign-left variable"><span class="token environment constant">PS1</span></span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"[\u@\h \W]\$ "</span>
</code></pre>
<p>the following prompt would be:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token punctuation">[</span>youkwhd@severus ~<span class="token punctuation">]</span>$ <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">"youkwhd.github.io"</span>
<span class="token punctuation">[</span>youkwhd@severus ~<span class="token punctuation">]</span>$ yay -S icecat <span class="token function">vim</span>
</code></pre>
<p>if you chose to use the long-prompt-like one, then i wouldn't have to consider paddings, but it depens on your preferences. Keep experimenting and you'll eventually like it.</p>
<h2 id="x-bar-status">X Bar status</h2>
<p>your window manager bar (i3bar, dwmblocks, etc) are one of the aspect of making a good rice. A messy, gray colored font for X bar will sometimes resulting in a bad X bar, and could even make it worse to read. What you can do is to add some life into it, an example of it is to use emojis as an advantage for you to make your X bar pretty. Or you can even use font-awesome as an alternative.</p>
<h2 id="rounded-terminal-shadow-and-outline">Rounded terminal, shadow and outline</h2>
<p>as mentioned above, adding these can result a nice feel, and make your terminal stands out. Tho it's only an additional option, add what's needed and what suits your style. don't over tweak things.</p>
<p>you can take a reference with these rices:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="keep-the-theme-on-fit">Keep the theme on fit</h2>
<p>You can easily generate dynamic color schemes using pywal, any other premade themes like gruvbox, dracula, etc. Is a valid option especially if you are just getting started and wanted a stable color scheme. I don't recommend you to make your own theme / color scheme as a beginner, but rather if you are good at UI/UX or designing things, then go for it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>here comes the conclusion, don't be afraid to change things up, especially for your own good. If you are too afraid to make a mistake, configure a virtual machine, then use it as an experiment GNU/Linux rice, tho you might have more issues with virtual machines, it's still a good alternative way to ricing.</p>
<p>keep your attention to small details like spaces in between windows. When it comes to customizing your GNU/Linux, if you ever feel like it's wonky, re-check if anything doesn't make sense, e.g; your theme doesn't match, or if it's too bright.</p>
<p>happy hacking!</p>]]></content:encoded>
