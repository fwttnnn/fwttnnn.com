# why gatsby?

In this post, we will learn different methods to change the format of date in JavaScript; but to do that, first, we will need a variable to store the value of the date. JavaScript has an inbuilt data type (date object) that can be used to store dates. Note: We will use the browser console to demonstrate examples performed in this post.


Depending on your skill level this could be a trivial task, but it is perfect for an example of how comments can be useful.

If you just jump straight into the code and start trying to make this modal then chances are you will get stuck and be unsure where to start or what to do next, especially if you have never built a modal before. This is why instead when you are presented with a problem that you are unsure of you need to think through what the steps are to complete that project without any code.

In our example we know that we have a button that we can click to open the modal and we also have an overlay that we need to show when we click on that button. We also have a close button that should close the modal and overlay when we click on it. With this in mind we can easily write out a guideline of steps to take to complete this project.
